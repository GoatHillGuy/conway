This is my rendition of the Conways Game of Life simulation.

There are a few commands to edit the board, the guide for said commands being accessible by
left clicking the question mark icon. These commands will be listed below, for your convenience.

Left click on cell - Turns cell on/off depending on prior state
Right click - Copies pattern to screen. Currently only gosper glider gun - better pattern copying will be implemented later
Space bar - Pause/Unpause simulation
E - Move single step in simulation
F - Clear grid entirely
R - Randmise grid entirely
WASD - Move up, left, down, and right respectively
CZ - Zoom in and out respectively

# IMPORTANT INFO
